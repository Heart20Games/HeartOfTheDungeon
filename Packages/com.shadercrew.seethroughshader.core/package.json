  "description": "The See-through Shader lets you see your playable characters inside any mesh without being obstructed by it. It doesn't matter if it is a building, a bridge, a cave, or whatever else you can imagine.\r\n\r\nJust apply the shader using one of our provided tools, register a player and it works. The best thing about it is: It doesn't need any additional changes to your mesh!\r\nWe included plenty of super helpful tools to get the effect to work within seconds.\r\nFor a non-player-based setup use our player-independent standard dissolve feature or a mix of both.",
