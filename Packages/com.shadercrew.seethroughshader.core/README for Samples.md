There are several ways of how to install the STS samples:

STS Custom Window:
Go to Window -> See-through Shader -> Sample Importer. There you can press "Import" and our custom window imports the samples for you.

Unity:
Go to Unity -> Window -> Package Manager -> Select the See-through Shader package. There under "Samples" you should be able to install the examples :)
