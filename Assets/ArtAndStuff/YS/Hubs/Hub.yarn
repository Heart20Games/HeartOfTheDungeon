Rotta: You may have the fancy dice, but that doesn’t make you a dungeon master. I still don’t see what the old man saw in you. I’ll go along with it for now, but don’t think we’re friends. #line:H001

<<elseif $xp < 2>>

Rotta: Thank you, Gobkin. I didn’t think it was possible to reconnect with my father. And yet somehow, you found a way. I’m beginning to understand why Baelor chose you. #line:H002

<<elseif $xp > 1>>

Rotta: Poor Osseus. I know what it is to grieve for a loved one, but to see them killed before your eyes. Baelor was right about that old skeleton… death did nothing to dim their spirit. #line:H003

Osseus: Well done little Gobkin, I must say, despite your limited intellect you have a way with words. <br>You seem to bring the best out of every creature you meet. <br>Perhaps that is why Baelor gave the dice to you. #line:H005

Gobkin: Hi slimefwend! #line:H007
Sir Slimeington: JIGGLE!? WIBBLE WOBBLE! #line:H008
Gobkin: Hrrrh? #line:H009
Osseus: He says how dare you speak to him. Do you know not know his lineage? <br>He is Sir Slimeington Wobbleton the Fourth, Duke of Bibblesville, Viceroy of Wibbleston, and Lord of Slimes.’ #line:H010
Gobkin: He says all that? #line:H011
Osseus: Basically, though some of what he said wasn’t fit for polite creatures like us, so I won’t repeat it. #line:H012

Gobkin: Herrowww Slimefriend! #line:H013
Sir Slimeington: WIBBLE? WOBBLE WOBBLE, JIGGLE… BLIBBLE… #line:H014
Osseus: He says you again? He thought he made it clear last time you weren’t to speak to him. <br>Though he is… well impressed isn’t the word, there’s not really a direct translation. <br>Closest I can get is just imagine he’s telling you good job, <br>but also slapping you across the face while he’s saying it. #line:H015

Osseus: Thank you Sir Slimeington. He said that you should not despair Gobkin. Baelor chose well when he gave you the dice. <br>Death? Death comes for us all, many never having truly lived. <br>To fully embrace who you are, while the world tells you you’re wrong, is true courage. <br>He says he was wrong about you, and he will stand with you in the final battle. #line:H018
